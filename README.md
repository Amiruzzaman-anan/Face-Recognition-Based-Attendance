# Face Recognition Based Attendance
The Face Recognition Based Attendance System uses face recognition technology to automate student attendance tracking in educational institutions. It captures live video or images, matches them against a registered database of faces, and marks attendance in real-time. The system also sends email notifications for absent students. With a user-friendly interface, it simplifies data management, allows for model training, and generates reports. By streamlining attendance processes, it reduces paperwork and improves overall efficiency.
